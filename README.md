# An interactive dashboard 

Use this to explore a dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Dataset

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of
people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this dashBoard you will see the top ID micrbial species and a bubble graph of detail informaci√≥n of each ID.
